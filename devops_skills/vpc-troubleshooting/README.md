# VPC Networking Diagnostics Skill

Agent skill for investigating and troubleshooting AWS VPC networking problems using structured runbooks, anti-hallucination guardrails, and systematic investigation workflows.

---

## What This Skill Covers

Structured troubleshooting for VPC networking when basic connectivity checks aren't enough — route table analysis, security group/NACL evaluation, flow log analysis, DNS resolution, NAT/IGW configuration, peering/TGW routing, VPN tunnel state, endpoint policies, and subnet capacity.

### Activate When

- Resources can't communicate within a VPC
- Internet access is broken (NAT, IGW)
- Cross-VPC connectivity fails (peering, Transit Gateway)
- DNS resolution fails (VPC DNS, private hosted zones, Route 53 Resolver)
- VPN or Direct Connect is down
- Security groups or NACLs are blocking traffic
- VPC endpoints not working (gateway or interface)
- Subnet IP exhaustion
- Route table misconfiguration
- Flow logs show unexpected REJECT entries
- MTU/fragmentation issues
- The user says something is wrong with VPC networking

## Guardrails & Anti-Hallucination

### Networking Guardrails (`vpc-networking-guardrails.md`)
12 rules covering: SG stateful vs NACL stateless, SG allow-only rules, NACL rule ordering, public subnet definition, peering non-transitivity, reserved IPs, NAT gateway placement, flow log limitations, MTU clamping, endpoint types, TGW route tables, and DNS attributes.

### Hallucination Patterns (`vpc-hallucination-patterns.yaml`)
8 patterns that LLMs commonly get wrong about VPC networking, including:
- Claiming security groups have deny rules (they don't)
- Applying stateful behavior to NACLs (they're stateless)
- Claiming VPC peering is transitive (it's not)
- Suggesting a "public subnet" attribute exists (it's route-table-based)
- Claiming flow logs identify which rule blocked traffic (they don't)

## Investigation Workflow

Each runbook follows a consistent phased structure:

### Phase 1 — Triage
Collect initial evidence using VPC APIs, route tables, security groups, NACLs, and flow logs. Classify the failure domain.

### Phase 2 — Enrich / Remediate
Deep dive using Reachability Analyzer, DNS testing, VPN/DX diagnostics, or endpoint configuration review.

### Phase 3 — Report
State root cause with evidence, severity, and recommended mitigations.

### Output Format
```yaml
root_cause: "<category> — <detail>"
evidence:
  - type: <source>
    content: "<specific finding>"
severity: CRITICAL | HIGH | MEDIUM
mitigation:
  immediate: "<action>"
  long_term: "<prevention>"
```

## Prerequisites

- AWS CLI or SDK access with VPC, EC2, Route 53, and CloudWatch permissions
- For flow log analysis: CloudWatch Logs or S3 access
- For Reachability Analyzer: `ec2:CreateNetworkInsightsPath` and `ec2:StartNetworkInsightsAnalysis`
- For VPN/DX: VPN and Direct Connect permissions
- For TGW: Transit Gateway permissions

## Usage Examples

### Can't Reach Internet from Private Subnet
```
Instances in subnet-abc can't reach the internet. They're in a private
subnet. Check NAT gateway, route tables, NACLs, and security groups.
```

### Cross-VPC Connectivity Failure
```
VPC-A (10.1.0.0/16) can't reach VPC-B (10.2.0.0/16) through Transit
Gateway. Check TGW attachments, TGW route tables, and VPC route tables.
```

### DNS Resolution Failure
```
Instances can't resolve internal.example.com. We have a private hosted
zone. Check VPC DNS settings and hosted zone associations.
```

### VPN Tunnel Down
```
Site-to-Site VPN vpn-abc has both tunnels DOWN. Check tunnel status,
IKE configuration, and customer gateway settings.
```
