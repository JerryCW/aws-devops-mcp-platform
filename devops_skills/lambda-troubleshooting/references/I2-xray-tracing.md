title: "I2 — X-Ray Tracing Issues"
description: "Diagnose X-Ray tracing configuration and data issues for Lambda"
status: active
severity: LOW
triggers:
  - "X-Ray.*no traces"
  - "tracing.*not working"
owner: devops-agent
objective: "Enable and fix X-Ray tracing for Lambda"
context: "X-Ray tracing must be enabled on the function (Active or PassThrough mode). Execution role needs xray:PutTraceSegments and xray:PutTelemetryRecords. SDK must be instrumented for downstream call tracing."
---

## Common Issues

- symptoms: "No traces in X-Ray console"
  diagnosis: "Tracing not enabled on function, or execution role missing X-Ray permissions."
  resolution: "Enable tracing: `aws lambda update-function-configuration --tracing-config Mode=Active`. Add xray:PutTraceSegments permission."

- symptoms: "Traces show Lambda but not downstream calls"
  diagnosis: "SDK not instrumented with X-Ray. Must wrap AWS SDK and HTTP clients."
  resolution: "Use aws-xray-sdk to instrument SDK clients and HTTP calls."


## Safety Ratings

```
safety_ratings:
  - "Review logs and metrics: GREEN - Read-only observability data access"
  - "Modify configuration: YELLOW - Changes service behavior, verify in non-production first"
  - "Delete/Remove resources: RED - Potentially irreversible, requires confirmation"
  - "Modify IAM/permissions: RED - Security-sensitive, may break access patterns"
```

## Escalation Conditions

- Function serves a production API or critical workload
- Fix requires changing reserved concurrency settings
- Function is processing sensitive data (PII, financial, healthcare)
- Resolution involves modifying VPC configuration or security groups
- Multiple functions affected suggesting account-level issue

## Data Sensitivity

HIGH - Lambda function code and environment variables may contain secrets, API keys, database credentials, and encryption keys. CloudWatch logs may capture sensitive request/response data. X-Ray traces may contain PII in segment metadata.

## Prohibited Actions

- NEVER suggest setting reserved concurrency to 0 - this effectively disables the function
- NEVER suggest deleting a function alias that is serving live traffic
- NEVER recommend removing or replacing the execution role on a running function without verifying the new role has equivalent permissions
- NEVER suggest publishing function code changes directly to a production alias without testing
- NEVER expose environment variable values in logs or diagnostic output - they may contain secrets

## Phase 3 - Rollback

1. If function configuration was changed, revert using: `aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name <name> --memory-size <original> --timeout <original>`
2. If execution role was modified, revert IAM policy changes and verify function can still access required resources
3. If event source mapping was modified, restore original configuration: `aws lambda update-event-source-mapping --uuid <uuid> --batch-size <original>`
## Output Format

```yaml
root_cause: "<tracing_disabled|missing_permission|sdk_not_instrumented>"
severity: LOW
mitigation:
  immediate: "Enable tracing and add permissions"
  long_term: "Instrument all SDK clients with X-Ray SDK"
```

## Escalation Conditions

escalation_conditions:
  - "Remediation requires modifying IAM policies in a production account"
  - "Remediation requires disabling a security control even temporarily"
  - "Root cause cannot be identified after 3 hypothesis pivots"
  - "Blast radius affects more than one account or region"
  - "Issue involves potential data loss or exposure"

## Data Sensitivity

data_sensitivity:
  - command: "get-function-configuration"
    sensitivity: MEDIUM
    contains: "Service configuration and resource details"
  - command: "get-policy"
    sensitivity: MEDIUM
    contains: "Service configuration and resource details"
  - command: "invoke"
    sensitivity: MEDIUM
    contains: "Service configuration and resource details"

## Prohibited Actions

prohibited_actions:
  - "NEVER suggest Resource: * in Lambda execution role"
  - "NEVER suggest disabling VPC configuration to fix connectivity"
  - "NEVER expose function URLs without authentication"
