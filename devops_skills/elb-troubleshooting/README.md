# ELB Diagnostics Skill

Agent skill for investigating and troubleshooting Elastic Load Balancing problems using structured runbooks, anti-hallucination guardrails, and systematic investigation workflows.

---

## What This Skill Covers

Structured troubleshooting for ALB, NLB, and CLB when the console alone isn't enough — 5xx errors, health check failures, target registration, SSL/TLS certificate issues, sticky sessions, cross-zone load balancing, WAF integration, slow targets, connection draining, and path-based routing.

### Activate When

- 502, 503, or 504 errors from the load balancer
- Health checks failing for targets
- Targets not registering or deregistering slowly
- SSL/TLS certificate errors or negotiation failures
- Sticky sessions not working
- Cross-zone load balancing issues
- WAF blocking legitimate traffic
- Slow response times through the load balancer
- Connection draining taking too long
- Path-based or host-based routing not working
- NLB source IP preservation issues
- WebSocket connection failures through ALB
