title: "J1 — Encryption Configuration"
description: "Diagnose encryption at rest and in transit for RDS PostgreSQL"
status: active
severity: HIGH
triggers:
  - "encryption"
  - "KMS"
  - "SSL"
  - "TLS"

## Phase 1 — Triage

MUST:
- Check encryption status: `aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier <id> --query 'DBInstances[0].[StorageEncrypted,KmsKeyId]'`
- Check SSL enforcement: `aws rds describe-db-parameters --db-parameter-group-name <group> --query 'Parameters[?ParameterName==\`rds.force_ssl\`]'`
- Check SSL connection:
  ```sql
  SELECT ssl, version, cipher FROM pg_stat_ssl WHERE pid = pg_backend_pid();
  ```

SHOULD:
- Check KMS key status and policy
- Verify client uses `sslmode=verify-full` for production

## Phase 2 — Remediate

- Encrypt unencrypted instance: snapshot → copy with encryption → restore
- Enforce SSL: set `rds.force_ssl=1` in parameter group
- Client connection: `psql "host=<endpoint> dbname=<db> user=<user> sslmode=verify-full sslrootcert=global-bundle.pem"`
- Download CA bundle: `https://truststore.pki.rds.amazonaws.com/global/global-bundle.pem`

## Safety Ratings
- GREEN: describe-db-instances (StorageEncrypted, KmsKeyId), describe-key, SHOW ssl, pg_stat_ssl — read-only inspection
- YELLOW: modify-db-parameter-group (rds.force_ssl), modify-db-instance (CA certificate) — recoverable changes
- RED: kms disable-key, kms schedule-key-deletion, delete-db-instance — extremely destructive operations

## Escalation Conditions
- "Database serves production traffic"
- "KMS key disabled or pending deletion — instance may become inaccessible"
- "Fix requires parameter group change to enforce SSL (needs reboot)"
- "Fix involves modifying encryption settings"
- "Data loss risk identified"

## Data Sensitivity
- HIGH: KMS key IDs, key policies, encryption configuration (core security infrastructure)
- HIGH: SSL/TLS certificates, connection strings with SSL parameters
- HIGH: database credentials

## Prohibited Actions
- "NEVER suggest disabling encryption on an encrypted database"
- "NEVER suggest deleting or disabling KMS keys without understanding impact"
- "NEVER suggest setting innodb_force_recovery or modifying pg_hba.conf directly"
- "NEVER suggest removing SSL enforcement without confirming all clients support the change"

## Phase 3 — Rollback
- "If KMS key was disabled, re-enable immediately: aws kms enable-key"
- "If KMS key deletion was scheduled, cancel immediately: aws kms cancel-key-deletion"
- "Revert SSL enforcement parameter changes and reboot if needed"

## Safety Ratings

safety_ratings:
  - "Phase 1 triage commands (describe/get/list): GREEN — read-only"
  - "Phase 2 configuration changes: YELLOW — state-changing but recoverable"
  - "Phase 2 resource deletion or security changes: RED — destructive or irreversible"

## Escalation Conditions

escalation_conditions:
  - "Remediation requires modifying IAM policies in a production account"
  - "Remediation requires disabling a security control even temporarily"
  - "Root cause cannot be identified after 3 hypothesis pivots"
  - "Blast radius affects more than one account or region"
  - "Issue involves potential data loss or exposure"

## Prohibited Actions

prohibited_actions:
