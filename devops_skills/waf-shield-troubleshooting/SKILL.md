# WAF & Shield Diagnostics

## When to use

Any WAF or Shield investigation where the console alone is insufficient — rule evaluation analysis, false positive/negative debugging, managed rule group troubleshooting, DDoS protection verification, logging configuration, integration issues, or Bot Control and ATP tuning.

## Investigation workflow

### Step 1 — Collect and triage

```
aws wafv2 list-web-acls --scope REGIONAL
aws wafv2 list-web-acls --scope CLOUDFRONT --region us-east-1
aws wafv2 get-web-acl --name <acl-name> --scope <REGIONAL|CLOUDFRONT> --id <acl-id>
aws wafv2 get-web-acl-for-resource --resource-arn <resource-arn>
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --namespace AWS/WAFV2 --metric-name AllowedRequests --dimensions Name=WebACL,Value=<acl-name> Name=Rule,Value=ALL Name=Region,Value=<region> --start-time <start> --end-time <end> --period 300 --statistics Sum
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --namespace AWS/WAFV2 --metric-name BlockedRequests --dimensions Name=WebACL,Value=<acl-name> Name=Rule,Value=ALL Name=Region,Value=<region> --start-time <start> --end-time <end> --period 300 --statistics Sum
```

### Step 2 — Rule deep dive

```
aws wafv2 get-web-acl --name <acl-name> --scope <scope> --id <acl-id> --query 'WebACL.Rules[*].{Name:Name,Priority:Priority,Action:Action,OverrideAction:OverrideAction}'
aws wafv2 get-rule-group --name <group-name> --scope <scope> --id <group-id>
aws wafv2 list-managed-rule-sets --scope <scope>
aws wafv2 describe-managed-rule-group --vendor-name AWS --name <rule-group-name> --scope <scope>
aws wafv2 get-sampled-requests --web-acl-arn <acl-arn> --rule-metric-name <metric-name> --scope <scope> --time-window StartTime=<start>,EndTime=<end> --max-items 100
aws wafv2 get-rate-based-statement-managed-keys --scope <scope> --web-acl-name <acl-name> --web-acl-id <acl-id> --rule-name <rule-name>
```

### Step 3 — Detailed investigation

```
aws wafv2 get-logging-configuration --resource-arn <web-acl-arn>
aws wafv2 list-ip-sets --scope <scope>
aws wafv2 get-ip-set --name <ip-set-name> --scope <scope> --id <ip-set-id>
aws wafv2 list-regex-pattern-sets --scope <scope>
aws wafv2 get-regex-pattern-set --name <set-name> --scope <scope> --id <set-id>
aws shield describe-subscription
aws shield list-protections
aws shield describe-protection --resource-arn <resource-arn>
aws shield describe-attack --attack-id <attack-id>
aws shield list-attacks --start-time FromInclusive=<start>,ToExclusive=<end>
aws cloudtrail lookup-events --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=EventSource,AttributeValue=wafv2.amazonaws.com
```

## Gotchas: WAF & Shield

- Rule evaluation order: rules are evaluated by priority number, lowest number first. If a request matches a rule with priority 1 (Block), it is blocked before priority 2 (Allow) is ever evaluated. Priority numbers must be unique within a web ACL.
- WAF Capacity Units (WCU): each web ACL has a 1,500 WCU limit. Each rule consumes WCUs based on complexity. Text transformations, regex patterns, and size constraint statements cost more WCUs. Managed rule groups publish their WCU requirements. Exceeding the limit prevents adding more rules.
- Rate-based rule minimum: the minimum rate limit is 100 requests per 5-minute window. You cannot set a threshold lower than 100. Rate evaluation uses a sliding window, not fixed 5-minute blocks. IPs are blocked once they exceed the threshold and unblocked when they drop below.
- Managed rule group versioning: AWS managed rule groups are versioned. By default, the web ACL uses the default version set by AWS. You can pin to a specific version. AWS may update the default version, which can change blocking behavior. Always test version changes in Count mode first.
- Shield Standard vs Advanced: Shield Standard is free and automatically protects all AWS resources against common L3/L4 DDoS attacks. Shield Advanced ($3,000/month per organization) adds L7 protection, DDoS cost protection, 24/7 SRT access, advanced metrics, and WAF fee waiver for resources protected by Shield Advanced.
- Shield Response Team (SRT) requirements: SRT engagement requires Shield Advanced subscription AND an IAM role granting SRT access to your WAF and Shield resources. Without the IAM role, SRT cannot assist. Create the role using `aws shield create-subscription` and `aws shield associate-drt-role`.
- WAF logging: logs must go to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, S3 bucket, or CloudWatch Logs log group. Firehose delivery stream name MUST start with `aws-waf-logs-`. S3 bucket name MUST start with `aws-waf-logs-`. CloudWatch log group MUST start with `aws-waf-logs-`. Logs include full request headers but NOT the request body.
- Regex pattern set limits: maximum 10 regex patterns per regex pattern set. Each pattern can be up to 200 characters. Regex uses Java-compatible syntax (PCRE-like). Complex regex patterns consume more WCUs.
- IP set limits: maximum 10,000 IP addresses per IP set. Supports IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR notation. You must specify the IP version when creating the set. Use /32 for single IPv4 addresses and /128 for single IPv6 addresses.
- Scope — REGIONAL vs CLOUDFRONT: REGIONAL scope protects ALB, API Gateway, AppSync, Cognito, App Runner, and Verified Access. CLOUDFRONT scope protects CloudFront distributions and MUST be created in us-east-1. A web ACL in REGIONAL scope cannot be attached to CloudFront and vice versa.
- Rule action override in managed groups: when adding a managed rule group to a web ACL, you can override individual rule actions to Count instead of Block. This lets you test rules before enforcing them. Use `OverrideAction` at the group level (None or Count) and `RuleActionOverrides` for individual rules.
- Custom response bodies: you can define custom response bodies (up to 4 KB each, max 50 per web ACL) in JSON, HTML, or plain text. Custom responses can include custom headers. Response status codes can be 200-599. Custom responses only apply to Block actions.
- Label matching across rules: rules can add labels to matching requests. Subsequent rules (higher priority number) can match on those labels using label match statements. Labels are scoped to the web ACL evaluation context and do not persist beyond the evaluation. Labels enable multi-stage rule logic.
- Bot Control and ATP costs: Bot Control common level is included with WAF. Bot Control targeted level costs $10 per million requests. Account Takeover Prevention (ATP) costs $10 per thousand login attempts analyzed. These are in addition to standard WAF charges. Enable in Count mode first to estimate costs.

## Anti-hallucination rules

1. Always cite specific web ACL configurations, rule priorities, sampled requests, or API responses as evidence.
2. Rule evaluation order is by priority number, lowest first. Never claim rules are evaluated alphabetically, by creation date, or by any other ordering.
3. Rate-based rules have a minimum threshold of 100 requests per 5-minute window. Never claim you can set a lower threshold.
4. Shield Standard does NOT provide L7 DDoS protection, DDoS cost protection, or SRT access. Never claim Shield Standard includes these features.
5. WAF logging destination names MUST start with `aws-waf-logs-`. Never omit this prefix requirement.
6. Spend no more than 2 minutes on any single hypothesis. Pivot if inconclusive.
